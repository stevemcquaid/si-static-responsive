Joseph is part of the Sensory Interactive Content Creation Team, with a keen focus on 3D modeling and animation. From flawless studio product models to fully articulated building interiors and exteriors, Joseph's mastery of form, texture, lighting and motion enable Sensory Interactive to deliver breathtaking simulations of anything we and our clients can dream up. Joseph's ability to work with teams to rapidly turn sketch concepts into photo-real renderings of object and space plays a key role in all parts of the project lifecycle: helping clients envision indoor and outdoor installations in architectural space before they are built, then utilizing the same artistry and design skill to develop stunning static, animated, and interactive content for those very same installations.

For years, Joseph has played a key role in Sensory Interactive projects around the world, developing presentation materials and content for projects in South Korea, Canada, China, and all over the United States. Always eager to explore the latest in 3D technique and technology, Joseph keeps Sensory Interactive's 3D capabilities on the bleeding edge.

Joseph is a graduate of The New England Institute of Art with a BS in Media Arts and Animation.
