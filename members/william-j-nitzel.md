"Bill Nitzel has more than 25 years of architectural design and project management experience, covering a broad range of institutional, commercial, and residential projects. He also has an extensive background in land planning and site development, acquired through work in planned communities in Columbia, Maryland, and the Fairwood development in Prince Georges County, Maryland.

Prior to joining Sensory Interactive, Bill was a partner and Vice President at SWB Architects, a Baltimore-based firm that he joined in 1991. This experience as the leader of a diverse, full-service architectural practice, along with his understanding of multiple building types, makes him well suited to managing the demands of Sensory Interactive’s complex projects.

Throughout his career, Bill has nurtured a growing interest in the integration of technology and architecture, and the capacity of this integration to create more dynamic and compelling environments. Bill’s work with Sensory Interactive is a natural extension of this interest, and his involvement with projects like the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center and 1515 Broadway in New York’s Times Square are putting him on the cutting edge of this rapidly evolving field."
