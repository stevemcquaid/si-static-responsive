Larry Zoll is responsible for ensuring that the interactive content and technology solutions developed by the firm work together to create the most compelling user experience possible in every one of our projects. With a background in both the theatrical and architectural lighting industries, and a master of fine arts degree in lighting design from the University of Maryland, Larry possesses an unparalleled ability to address the technical and creative needs of a truly successful interactive environment.

Prior to joining Sensory Interactive, Larry spent nearly a decade working in various facets of the lighting and display industry, beginning as a theatrical electrician and eventually launching his own consulting practice providing lighting system design, programming, and support services to architects and cultural institutions.

In addition to his work on Sensory Interactive’s 1515 Broadway and Boston Convention & Exhibition Center projects, Larry’s recent experience includes lighting design for a pedestrian bridge serving as a centerpiece for the revitalization of Lawrence, Massachusetts; the development of a lighting control system for the Glick Peace Walk on the Indianapolis Cultural Trail; lighting design for The Big C portion of the SHOWtime Showhouse project; and the creation of a computer-controlled, mechanized airflow system for artist Janet Echelman’s kinetic sculptures at San Francisco International Airport.
