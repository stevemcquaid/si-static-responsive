The understanding gained during this initial analysis process enabled the Sensory Interactive team to take a very ROI-focused approach to our subsequent work the system’s planning, design, implementation, and operational management.

The display system was deployed in conjunction with a renovation of the building’s retail spaces, and includes both digital and static signage, as well as an LED “light wash” of the building’s upper-level crown detail. The team selected an integrated content delivery system that allows operators to synchronize the LED accent lighting with the digital displays, increasing the building’s profile in Times Square and enhancing the visibility and value of the LED video content.
