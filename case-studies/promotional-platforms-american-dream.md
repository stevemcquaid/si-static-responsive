American Dream, located in the Meadowlands just outside of New York City, includes a massive enclosed retail center, entertainment venues, dining, and major attractions such as an indoor ice rink, amusement park, Ferris wheel, ski and snowboard park, and a water park. The project is also adjacent to an existing 17,000-seat arena, and includes a bridge/skywalk to the MetLife stadium.

Project owner Triple FiveÂ® Worldwide asked Sensory Interactive to develop, deploy, and operate a fully integrated dynamic environment and sponsorship program. Our work began with extensive studies of the property to identify appropriate locations and placement for a multitude of large-format displays and interactive digital components for wayfinding and digital-out-of-home advertising.

We also developed detailed user personas in order to fully understand the demographics, motivations, and activities of potentials visitors to this diverse venue. Using these personas, we are able to make informed decisions about the quantity, location, content, design, and interactivity for a wide range of components, from outdoor digital displays on highway approaches to more intimate experiences with interactive walls within the retail and entertainment spaces. Pre-visit and mobile-device interactions are also being considered as part of the overall guest experience, enabling sponsors and brands to connect with customers in new and groundbreaking ways.

Sensory Interactive is also performing a technology-agnostic evaluation of possible hardware, software, A/V integration, and media sales systems. As the project progresses, we will continues to develop technical design criteria for all exterior and interior digital sponsor signage, evaluate opportunities for parking garage sponsorship, create concepts and templates for interactive platforms, and develop other indoor branded environments.

This unique and comprehensive approach to digital platform development is attracting the attention of top advertisers eager to capitalize on a one-of-a-kind sponsorship experience that delivers consistent engagement with consumers throughout their visit to the project.
