title: Large Format Outdoor ^ Verizon Center
description: For the facility’s exterior Sensory Interactive created a system of eight individual exterior displays with a total surface area of more than 4,300 square feet. The size of these displays, their distribution across the building facade, and their excellent visibility – even in bright light – create an ""immersive” experience for viewers. This immersive quality is extremely attractive to advertisers and sponsors wanting to reach the highly mobile audience found near the arena.

Verizon Center owner/operator Monumental Sports & Entertainment turned to Sensory Interactive to conceptualize, program, design, and implement an integrated system of high-resolution, full-motion video displays that would create new advertising and sponsorship opportunities, while also helping to build excitement leading up to and during the facility's events. The building's high profile location in the nation's capital and its role as the home to three professional sports franchises made it essential that the system's design, technology, and content adhere to the highest standards.

For the facility’s exterior Sensory Interactive created a system of eight individual exterior displays with a total surface area of more than 4,300 square feet. The size of these displays, their distribution across the building facade, and their excellent visibility – even in bright light – create an ""immersive” experience for viewers. This immersive quality is extremely attractive to advertisers and sponsors wanting to reach the highly mobile audience found near the arena.

During the design process, the Sensory Interactive team worked closely with the owner to obtain Washington D.C. District Council approval for the system's design and proposed content. This included participating in discussions with area business owners and residents, and assisting in testimony before the District Council.

We also selected and deployed a new content delivery system that runs both the new exterior displays and all of the legacy display systems inside of the arena. This system, from European stadium technology specialist Colosseo, gives event production staff extremely precise control of all of the venue’s digital displays, allowing them to easily deliver the most exciting experience to fans and the greatest impact for advertisers, with much-reduced staffing requirements.

Sensory Interactive staff continues to work with Verizon Center in handling all day-to-day operations of the exterior displays, scheduling all content, and monitoring scheduled maintenance and service tasks. Our content and creative services team works closely with the arena’s marketing and production departments on the development of new dynamic content for the displays, as well as on custom marketing communications to promote opportunities to potential advertisers and sponsors.

Sensory Interactive's full-service approach to the project yielded a digital video display program worthy of this world-class facility. By utilizing display and control technologies not previously seen in the marketplace, the system has exceeded expectations for advertising and sponsorship revenue, and has also received positive responses from event attendees and area residents.
