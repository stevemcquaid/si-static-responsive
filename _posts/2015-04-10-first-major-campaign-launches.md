The first major advertising campaign has launched on our recently completed digital media platform at 570 Seventh Avenue in New York's Times Square.

Developed by Target’s in-house creative team, the six-week campaign is utilizing all six of the system's digital faces and its integrated LED accent lighting.

The thoughtfully planned Target campaign is taking full advantage of the digital media components created by the Sensory Interactive team, which were conceived and designed to capitalize on the diverse benefits of the building’s unique, high-visibility location.

The tall, vertical signage and lighting elements are projecting a powerful brand presence for several blocks, while traditionally proportioned elements at street-level are being used for more in-depth storytelling.
